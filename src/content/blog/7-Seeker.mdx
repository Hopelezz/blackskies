## What is Seeker?

Seeker is an open-source project developed by [Mark Spratt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-spratt/) & [Christopher Strom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskc/), available on GitHub. It emerged from the necessity to navigate through complex directory structures efficiently. This led us to develop Seeker as a solution, focusing specifically on folder search.

Dealing with large volumes of files and folders can be daunting and time-consuming. Seeker simplifies this process by allowing users to search for folders within a predefined path quickly. Its lightweight design and emphasis on simplicity and efficiency make it an invaluable tool for individuals and teams seeking enhanced productivity and organization.

### Features

#### Simplified Folder Search

Seeker's primary feature is its ability to streamline folder search within a predefined path. It offers customizable search paths and search depth to specify the depth of the search for greater flexibility in exploration.

Think of the path as the starting point and the depth in how far down you want the search to go. This allows you to narrow down your search results and find the folders you're looking for quickly.
